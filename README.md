# ResTime

ResTime stands for Residence Time.

ResTime is a collecion of Python scripts to compute residence time from MD simulations.  That is, ResTime is a post-processing tool for trajectories.

The current implementation computes residence time around either selection or cubes.  ResTime requires two Python modules: Numpy (for matrix operations) and MDAnalysis (for loading trajectories and selections).   Current MDanalysis only works with Python 2.7.
